# promise-use-cases

Short lived repository in order to discuss Node.js promise use cases in Collaborator Summit Berlin 2018

### Contributing

Please consider PRing in things that are confusing with promises right now or are done better in userland. I will present the results (with your name and contribution) to Node.js core.

**No prior Node.js contribution experience required**. If you're a user of promises and thing we should do things better - we would love to hear about your use case.
