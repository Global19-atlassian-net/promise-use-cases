### Use Case #expectations-3

Name: Promise queue documentation

Eva wants to learn how Promises integrate with the general flow of the event loop, and what is the order of execution of Promises relative to everything else.

### What happens
Eva can't find an official documentation or source that explains about this :(

### Why it happens
Because Benji didn't write one :(((((

### What can we maybe do better
Provide official documentation on microticks and order of execution with regards to Promises and other async tasks like timers.
